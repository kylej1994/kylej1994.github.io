## Hi, I'm Kyle

![](/assets/github_pic.jpg){:height="50%" width="50%"}


I'm Kyle Jablon. I currently work at GrubHub on the e-commerce data science team. I'm currently pursuing a Masters in CS at Georgia Tech (specialization in Machine Learning). I'm also a '17 UChicago grad.

### The stack I'm used to working in.

I've been using Python, Pandas, and Spark since 2016, and their associated toolkits. 

Other stuff I use a lot: SQL, sklearn, xgBoost, TensorFlow, SHAP, Jenkins, Azkaban, docker, Dask


### Some public stuff I've worked on

- A blog post on [productionizing machine learning models at GrubHub](https://bytes.grubhub.com/just-what-i-needed-making-machine-learning-scalable-and-accessible-at-grubhub-24734cc4139d)

- I worked on a [machine learning ethics wiki](https://kylej1994.github.io/ml_ethics_wiki/) for my Masters class at Georgia Tech (OMSCS 6460: Education Technology). You can also view my [final presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RQpeGBAXGq4-BbpkztCL8TmDN43Oijeo/view?usp=sharing) for the class on my google drive.
